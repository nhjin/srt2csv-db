00:07:27,Stop the car!

00:12:32,It's like a bullfight!
00:12:34,Ever seen a bullfight?
00:12:36,I can't watch this.
00:12:37,"You're in such a bad mood. And I know why,"
00:12:40,It's because that man thought you were my father.
00:12:42,- No. - Yes.

00:13:01,"I love you,and I don't care how old you are."
00:13:04,"So stop beeing an gloomygoos,and stop beeing so hard on Manny."
00:13:07,The only reason i'm hard on Manny...
00:13:09,is just because i don't wanna see him make a fool of himself.
00:13:12,And I can smell that hairgoo of his from here!
00:13:15,"Look,I don't know what's gonna happen to him over there ..."
00:13:18,but you're his family now. And that means only one thing.
00:13:22,"You be there winning his back,not to spit in his face!"
00:13:28,"Something my mom always sais,it's georgeous in spanish."
00:13:32,"Look,he's there."
00:13:37,She has a boyfriend.
00:13:39,****
00:13:42,I gave her my heart. She gave me a picture of me as an oldtime sheriff.
00:13:49,"That was pretty stupidly,wasn't it?"
00:13:51,"No mi amore,it's was brave,right Jay? Brave."
00:13:55,I.. b... you'll know better next time. Come on! Let's get a pretzel.
00:14:07,"Oh,excuse me,sir? We asked all mall-walkers to stay to the right."
00:14:25,"Alex,get out! MOM!"
00:14:28,"Alex,leave you're sister alone!"
00:14:29,"I was just getting my book,gosh!"
00:14:31,"I know sweety,but you need to respect her privacy."

00:14:41,Okay... Okay...
00:14:44,"I'm making a cake for tonight,you wanna help me with the frosting?"
00:14:47,Sure.
00:14:50,"So,you know if Haley got pregnant,would you ever pretend she got mono for a few months"
00:14:55,and then tell everyone the baby's yours?
00:14:57,What?
00:14:58,"The senior at school was out sick for four months,"
00:15:01,but she was out breastfeeding in an cleanup carwash.
00:15:10,"- Buddy,what are you wearing? - Nothing."
00:15:15,"No jacket,no hat."
00:15:17,How many pairs of underwear do you have on?
00:15:20,One.
00:15:22,Six.
00:15:24,"First of all,it would be really cool to see Haley that fat,"
00:15:26,and how awesome would it be to have a fake little brother who's really my nephew.
00:15:30,Haley is not getting pregnant!
00:15:33,I'm just saying if.
00:15:34,"I know,and I know you like to make trouble for your sister,"
00:15:37,but it's not gonna work this time.
00:15:38,You know why?
00:15:40,'Cause you're sister is a good girl.
00:15:41,"I know,I was just like her when I was..."
00:15:46,"I want you to know,I'm not enjoying this."
00:15:48,"This is an emportant lesson that you're leaning,so."
00:15:51,"'S all good,keep it..."
00:15:56,"- You're to close,it's gonna hurt. - It's supposed to hurt!"
00:16:00,And why are you smiling?
00:16:02,I'm... What?
00:16:15,"Oh,forget it. I can't do this. The point is,you're scared."
00:16:19,I think you've learned you're lesson.
00:16:24,Mom?!
00:16:25,What are you doing?
00:16:26,"Hey,I was just dropping off some laundry,this is a bad time?"

00:16:31,"Oh,okay."
00:16:34,Can you shut the door please?
00:16:37,Actually we're just go ahead and leave that open.
00:16:39,Why?
00:16:40,"Because I have euh,seen this little show before"
00:16:43,"Lying on the bed with a tall,senior."

00:17:19,And he still does this thing were he announces himself before walking into any room were in.
00:17:23,Just to make sure he doesn't ever see us kiss.
00:17:27,Wish my mother had that system.
00:17:29,- Remember? - Not now.
00:17:32,I still can't beleve you did this to me!
00:17:34,Would you get in the spirit of things!

00:18:49,"Oh,God,if Cam comes out there with boobs,I'm leaving!"
00:18:51,"- Dad! - I hope he didn't embarrase you,mom."

00:19:01,"Anyway,so about a year ago."
00:19:03,"Cam and I sort have feeling this longing for something more...like,maybe a baby."
00:19:08,"Woooh,that's a bad idea."
00:19:10,"- What do you mean,bad idea? - Well,kids need a mother!"
00:19:13,"I mean,if you two guys are bored,get a dog!"
00:19:15,"We're not bored,dad!"
00:19:16,"I support you Mitchell,and tough you're not my son"
00:19:20,"I think what dad is trying to say is that,"
00:19:23,"Mitchell you're a little uptight,kids bring chaos..."
00:19:25,and you don't handle well.
00:19:27,That's not what's it's saying what you saying.
00:19:29,And it's insulting in an whole different way.
00:19:31,"Okay,people,let's all chillax!"
00:19:34,Where's uncle Cameron?
00:19:36,"Finally,thank you,someone who's not insulting me,noticed he's not here."
00:19:41,"So,that's the big announcement. You two broke up."
00:19:44,Well a baby wasn't gonna help that anyway!
00:19:46,"Let me tell you,your'll better of,because he was a bit of a dramaqueen."
00:19:49,"Stop,stop,"

00:20:22,"- The music! - Oh,yes,the music."
00:20:24,"Come,say hello Lilly."
00:20:37,Lilly? Isn't that gonna be hard for her to say?
00:20:42,"Okay,I know that I said I thought this was a bad idea."
00:20:46,But...
00:20:49,What do I know?
00:20:50,"I mean,It's not like I wrote a book on fatherhood."
00:20:53,"I'm trying whole my life to get it right,i'm still screwing up."
00:20:58,I wrote a song about it in the car.
00:21:00,Ofcourse you did.
00:21:03,"Anyway,I'm happy for ya! And you should know that..."
00:21:08,"...I'm not here to spit in your face,I'm here to blow at your back."
00:21:15,It's supposed to sound better in spanish.

00:21:42,"Eey,you're a cutie,aren't you!"
00:21:49,We're from different worlds.
00:21:51,Yet we somehow fit together.
00:21:54,Love is what's binds us.
00:21:57,"Through fair,or stormy weather."
00:22:00,I stand before you now with only one agenda
00:22:03,"To let you know my heart is yours. Feldman,Brenda"
00:22:12,"Look,so far,he hasn't beaten me at basketball."
00:22:23,Could you just do me a favour and just grab...
00:22:26,How's the weather down there?
00:22:28,"But,when the day comes that he does win,if,you know,if when he beats me."
00:22:33,"I'm just gonna be like,well done! Well done!"
00:22:36,"Just let him,just support him."
00:22:39,"In that kind of stuff. I'm probably just wanna go like,"
